# TypingSpeedTest

[Typing speed test](http://amnbot.pythonanywhere.com/) is a 4 people project designed during [SacHacks 2021](https://sachacks.io/) using Flask and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to help people improve their typing speed through a game. First, a random prompt appears on the user's screen. Then, the user copies it as fast as possible and with the least possible amount of errors. When the user is done, they have the choice to either generate a new prompt and start another game or to submit their score to the leaderboard, where all the competition happens.
